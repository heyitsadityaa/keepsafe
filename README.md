## <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>

A healthcare platform that streamlines patient registration, authentication and appointment scheduling. This platform will utilize Next.js for building the application, Appwrite for backend services, TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript, TailwindCSS for styling, and ShadCN for component management. The patient-facing side of the platform will allow users to manage their appointments, while an admin page will be provided to manage the number of scheduled, pending, and canceled appointments.
